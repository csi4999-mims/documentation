# Security and Ethical Concerns  
  
The data that is collected and analyzed in a missing person's case is
extremely sensitive and needs to be restricted to only certain users.
The personal information about a missing person that is provided by
their family, friends, phone, and social media accounts is private and
should only be accessible by Law Enforcement. The balance between
sharing enough information to the public to be helpful and maintaining
the privacy of the missing person is vital to the integrity of the
application. The data must be stored in a secure way and controlled via
role management.

Some of the ethical concerns that are related to the application are
that people who have access to the sensitive data might use it for
personal gain or inappropriate reasons. Also, some issues of how ethical
social media mining and analysis might be can come up. This concern can
be mitigated by ensuring that all users of the application consent to
the use of social media mining for any person they report missing. Users
of social media also already agree to have their data publicized to a
certain extent on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.

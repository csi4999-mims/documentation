Missing Persons is a section of Law Enforcement that handles cases
involving people who have gone missing for a variety of reasons
including drug use, runaways, human trafficking, etc. The process of
finding missing people is extremely taxing for Law Enforcement because
it is usually like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Law
Enforcement resources dedicated to handling missing persons cases are
often limited and it can be a time consuming process for Law Enforcement
to gather and analyze all the information related to a missing person.
The information provided by their family, friends, phones, and social
media accounts can be very helpful to Law Enforcement if organized in a
meaningful way. The concerned public could also be an untapped resource
in helping law enforcement find missing persons. Unfortunately, there is
no existing method that would allow the public to contribute in the
search for missing persons in a quick, easy and convenient manner.

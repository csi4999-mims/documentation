# Unit Test Architecture and Strategy Framework  
  
## Overview  
  
For our Unit Testing we will use PHPUnit which can be easily integrated with CakePHP. The testing 
framework can be installed by using the PHAR package or composer. For our case we used the composer to 
install PHPUnit.  
  
## Test Database Setup  
  
In order to do unit testing using PHPUnit we need to set up a test database for CakePHP to reference 
when we are testing various functions of our application.  
  
## Test Case Conventions  
  
The following are the conventions for creating test cases using CakePHP:  
1) PHP files containing tests should be in your tests/TestCase/[Type] directories  
2) The file names of these files should end in Test.php instead of just .php  
3) The classes containing tests should extend Cake\TestSuite\TestCase, 
Cake\TestSuite\IntegrationTestCase, or \PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase  
4) Like other class names, the test case class names should match the file name. EX. RouterTest.php 
should contain class RouterTest extends TestCase  
5) The name of any method containing a test case should begin with test, as in testPublished(). You can 
also use @test annotation to mark methods as test methods  
  
## Running Tests  
  
To run tests for a plugin that is part of your applcation source, you need to cd into the plugin 
directory and then use phpunit command that mathes how you installed phpunit  
  
### using composer installed phpunit  
../vendor/bin/phpunit  
  
### using phar file  
php ../phpunit.phar

# Subsystems and Component Design Pattern  
Our application uses the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern. With the use of CakePHP 3.0 as our framework, the exact design pattern is a variation of MVC where the model is broken down into three parts. The three parts of the model in CakePHP are Entity, Table, and Behavior.  

- Table: provide access to the collection of entities stored in a specific table.  
- Entity: contain persistent properties and methods to manipulate and access the data they contain.  
- Behavior: a way to organize and enable horizontal re-use of Model layer logic.

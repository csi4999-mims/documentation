# User Efforts Estimation  

## Function Point Analysis  

  * Number of User Inputs =  159 (level of complexity simple)  
  * Number of User Outputs = 2 (level of complexity average)
  * Number of User Inquiries = 1 (level of complexity simple)   
  * Number of Master Files =  104 (level of complexity complex)
  * Number of Interfaces = 12 (level of complexity average)  

  FP = (159 x 3) + (2 x 5) + (1 x 3) + (104 x 7) + (12 x 7)  
     = 477 + 10 + 3 + 728 + 84  
     = 1302

# Risks

1. Sensitive data being misused
    1. Risk Details
        1. Personal data about missing people will be maintained in the database for Law Enforcement to Access
        2. There will need to be restrictions to what data the Concerned Public can see
        3. The integrity of the data needs to be retained
    2. Risk Assessment
        1. Likelihood: 5
        2. Impact: 10
        3. Cost: 10
    3. Rank: 60  
    4. Mitigation Plan  
        Our mitigation plan for this is to create roles in the database and assign them to users (Public or Law Enforcement). This assigned role will affect the interface the user will see on the home page when they login.  
        
2. High volumes of data are not managed
    1. Risk Details
        1. The data needs to be stored in a way that makes sense
        2. It needs to be easily accessed and analyzed
    2. Risk Assessment
        1. Likelihood: 8  
        2. Impact: 5  
        3. Cost: 2  
    3. Rank: 36  
    4. Mitigation Plan  
        Our mitigation plan for this is to take extra time to plan and map out the database tables. We plan to do our best to organize the tables in a way that relates the data in a meningful way as well as ensures the integrity of the data.  
        
3. Image files are not managed/stored properly  
    1. Risk Details  
        1. Images need to be stored in a way that they are easily accessed and associated with the correct missing person report  
        2. The images need to be managed so they do not take up enormous amounts of space  
    2. Risk Assessment:  
        1. Likelihood: 5  
        2. Impact: 7  
        3. Costs: 8  
    3. Rank: 192  
    4. Mitigation Plan  
        Our mitigation plan is to look into the best way to store large amounts of image files and the best way to maintain their relationship to a specific entry in the database. This will ensure that all photos related to a specific missing person case are accessible and reliably associated with that case.
